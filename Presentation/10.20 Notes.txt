Topic: Cross Site Scripting


Notes: 
(definition)
- XSS: a type of security vulnerability found in web applications
-> a type of injection where malicious scripts are injected into trusted websites
-> attacker uses web application to inject malicious data/code in form of browser side scripts to a different end user
- XSS attacks occur when data is entered in a web application through an untrusted source, noteably through web requests
-> data has content that is sent to web users without being validated for malicious content
-> mostly in forms of JavaScript
-> most common attacks include transmitting private data (through cookies or sessions) to attacker
--> vitcim is redirected to web content controlled by attacker


(blog)
- found a vulnerability CVE-2021-24114 that ended in an account take over (ato)
- used the stickers feature to figure out how it works and to find the vulnerability
- inspected an HTTP request of sent sticker and sent simple HTML characters to different attributes
-> he does this to not trigger any javascript code directly

- used a CSP evaluator, showing "script-src" field to be "unsafe"
-> Content Security Policy (CSP)
- he found angular javascript in list
-> the version was outdated, so he was able to pass the CSP through the outdated version's vulnerability
-> alerts were being received
- he used <ifram srcdoc> to fit two created elements of JS and div on a single page and HTML encoding to make the characters be interpreted correctly

XSS vulnerability on MS Teams was found through user interaction

(article)
- researcher Numa Turle found a CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
- found bug CVE-2021-24114 last year in Teams iOS (Microsoft Teams App in iOS)
-> was in the "sticker" feature
-> could make an account vulnerable to takeovers
- researcher found potential attacks against multiple domains
-> told Microsoft Teams about this, and vulnerability was patched
- Microsoft Teams is a collaboration application
-> it was able to load third-party apps, integrate with other apps through APIS, and store data in ways where there are potential data loss incidents
-> an entire web browser that bad actors can attack using xss
